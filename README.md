# WaveGenerator
A small project for windows that can generate 'classic' sound waves, with 16 bit single channel PCM, such as Sinewaves, triangle, square,
sawtooth. These waves can be added together and multiplied 
(a 500Hz Sine multiplied by a 1Hz triangle will generate a strobe effect).
The generated waves can be saved to a .wav file.

To build simply open in the code Visual Studio and compile. The project uses the windows GUI library and media player.
